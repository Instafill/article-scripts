## üß† How Instafill.ai Works

### 1. **Upload Your Form (One-Time Setup)**
You start by uploading a static PDF ‚Äî such as a USCIS immigration form, a compliance report, or a municipal permit. Instafill‚Äôs AI scans the file, understands all fields, and applies internal tagging (e.g., ‚Äúcheckbox logic,‚Äù ‚Äúdate format‚Äù).

### 2. **Fine-Tuning for Accuracy**
The system goes through a 5‚Äì20 minute one-time fine-tuning process. This enables up to **100% field-level accuracy**, especially for complex forms with:
- Nested tables
- Conditional sections
- Attachment references (e.g., ‚ÄúSee Attachment A‚Äù)

### 3. **Feed It Data**
You can provide data in any of these ways:
- Typed text or form
- CSV or Excel files
- Document uploads (Word, scanned PDFs, IDs)
- Email forwarding (e.g., from Cognito Forms)
- Webhooks and API calls from your internal systems

### 4. **Generate Filled PDFs**
The AI fills out the form ‚Äî including logic-driven checkboxes, multi-line fields, and additional page attachments ‚Äî and returns a clean, ready-to-sign PDF. You can download them individually or in batch.
